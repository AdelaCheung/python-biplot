This is a simple script for Python that aims to replicate the most basic function -- and ease -- of the biplot() function in R. It is not meant to be a comprehensive tool, but a shortcut for quick visualization of PCA.

Feel free to change the script in any way to fit your needs; it is heavily commented to guide any edits you may need to make.

The script relies on three standard scientific Python packages: pandas, scikit-learn, & matplotlib.
